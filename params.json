{"name":"Emacs for Chrome","tagline":"Ymacs extended to work as a Chrome App and to use the Chrome filesystem.","body":"The files in this directory allow ymacs to be packaged into a Chrome\r\napp, including support for the Chrome filesystem api.  The filesystem\r\napi is kind of clunky, but it is managable. \r\n\r\nWe also add experimental support for some additional commands.  We\r\nhope that as this generic code settles, it can migrate to the ymacs\r\ncore.\r\n\r\nThe commands we add or modify are:\r\n\r\nC-x C-f find_file\r\nC-x C-w write_file\r\nC-x C-s save_file\r\nC-x s save_some_buffers\r\nC-x C-d list_directory (dired-like)\r\nM-% query_replace\r\nC-x C-c safe_exit (offer to save modified buffers, then exit)\r\nC-h c help_c (display function assigned to key)\r\nC-h m help_m (display commands defined in current keymaps)\r\n\r\n[search for defineKeys to make sure this list is complete]\r\n\r\nYou can download the packaged version from\r\n\r\nhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/emacs/pledjnbikkbieemanocnjeoacdcphlgf\r\n\r\nOr, you can run it locally as an \"unpacked extension\".  To do this,\r\nstart chrome, open the menu, click \"More tools\", then \"Extensions\" (or\r\nopen the url chrome://extensions ).  Then, click the button \"Load\r\nunpacked extension...\" and select your ymacs development directory\r\n(the parent of the directory where this README file appears).\r\n\r\nWe are grateful to Mihai Bazon for ymacs, and hope that you like our\r\nadditions.  We're working at https://github.com/pacew/ymacs and will\r\nbe happy to consider pull requests.\r\n\r\nPace Willisson <pace@alum.mit.edu>\r\nEric Willisson <ericwillisson@gmail.com>\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
